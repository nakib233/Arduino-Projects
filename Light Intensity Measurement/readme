**Introduction:**



Light intensity measurement plays a crucial role in applications like home automation, where it helps control lighting based on ambient conditions. The LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensor, also known as a photoresistor, is widely used for this purpose. It changes its resistance depending on the amount of light falling on it, enabling Arduino to measure light levels and respond accordingly.



**Hardware Components:**



* Arduino UNO Board: The microcontroller that reads sensor input and controls output devices.
* LDR Sensor: A photoresistor whose resistance decreases with increasing light intensity.
* Resistor (typically 1.5kΩ): Used in a voltage divider circuit with the LDR to convert resistance changes into measurable voltage changes.
* Breadboard and Jumper Wires: For easy circuit connections.
* LED: Can be used as an output indicator based on light intensity.
